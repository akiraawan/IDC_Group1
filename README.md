# Predictive Analytics in Cardiology: Leveraging Diagnostic Tools with Machine Learning To Classify Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD)
To what extent can machine learning methods aid the diagnosis of different heart diseases?
## Goal
Neural Network model that can take an image of an MRI scan and predict whether the heart is healthy or diseased

## Extension
Classifying each heart into the following:
- Normal 
- Myocardial Infarction (MINF) 
- Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) 
- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) 
- Abnormal right ventricle (ARV) = Not a specific disease, just pathology

Find another model on ECG and compare the MRI model vs ECG model and see which is more suitable for certain heart diseases.
